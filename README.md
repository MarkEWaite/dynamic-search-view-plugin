The Dynamic Search View plugin adds a new view option, which allows you to configure additional filters on top of your main view.

# About this plugin

The Dynamic Search View allows you to configure additional filters at the viewâ€™s main page, which are applied after selecting **Submit**.
This allows users to filter and search for jobs in one central view.

They will be fixed in future versions.
As always, contributions are appreciated by anyone!
